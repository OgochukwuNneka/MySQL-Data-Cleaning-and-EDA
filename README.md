## Data Cleaning Process

The initial step involved cleaning and transforming the dataset to ensure accuracy and consistency:

1. **Removed Duplicates**  
   Eliminate duplicate records to avoid skewed analysis results.
2. **Standardized the Data**  
   Cleaned column formats, ensured consistent date and string formats.
3. **Handled Null/Blank Values**  
   Replaced, imputed, or excluded null values based on relevance.
4. **Dropped Irrelevant Columns/Rows**  
   Removed columns or rows that added no analytical value.
